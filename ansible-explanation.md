# what is ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It allows users to define and manage infrastructure as code, enabling the automation of repetitive tasks and the configuration of systems in a reliable, consistent, and efficient manner.

# Playbook Overview

The playbook is run sequentially, ensuring that each step is completed before moving on to the next. This sequential execution is crucial for ensuring that dependencies are met and that the system is configured correctly at each stage.

# Roles and Their Functions

## test-connectivity

`Function`: This role is typically used to test connectivity to the managed nodes to ensure they are reachable and ready for configuration.
`Modules Used`: This role might use modules like ping or custom scripts to verify connectivity.
`Position`: First role, as verifying connectivity is essential before proceeding with any other tasks.

# update-server

`Function`: Updates the package list on the server to ensure that the latest packages are available for installation.
`Modules Used`: apt (for updating the package cache)
`Position`: Second role, ensuring the server is up-to-date before installing any software.

# setup-docker

`Function`: Installs Docker and Docker Compose, and adds the vagrant user to the Docker group.
`Modules Used`: apt (for package installation), user (for modifying user groups)
`Position`: Third role, since Docker needs to be set up before Docker Compose can be used to run containers.

# clone-repository

`Positioning`: This role is run after Docker setup, as the cloned code will be used to build Docker images.

`Ansible Module`: git

`repo`: The URL of the Git repository.
`dest`: The destination directory where the repository will be cloned.
`version`: The branch, tag, or commit to checkout (default is HEAD).

# update-directory-ownership

`Function`: Changes the ownership of the project directory to ensure the vagrant user has appropriate permissions.

`Positioning`: This role is run after cloning the repository to set the correct permissions on the project files.

`Ansible Module`: file

`path`: The directory to change ownership of.
`owner`: The new owner of the directory.
`group`: The new group of the directory.
`recurse`: Apply changes recursively to all files and directories within the specified path.

# run-docker-compose

`Function`: Runs Docker Compose to start the application containers.

`Positioning`: This role is run last to ensure that all previous setup steps are complete before attempting to start the containers.

`Ansible Module`: command

`command`: Runs the specified command.
`args`: Specifies additional arguments, such as the working directory (chdir).

organizing the playbook into distinct roles, each responsible for a specific part of the setup process, you ensure a modular and maintainable approach to automation. This allows for easier debugging, testing, and reuse of roles in different playbooks or projects.
